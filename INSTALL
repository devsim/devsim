Supported Platforms:
Ubuntu 12.04 32/64 bit
Redhat 6.4 32/64 bit
Mac OS X 10.6.8 64 bit

Substitute redhat_6.4 for ubuntu_12.04 for Redhat 6.4 installations in the instructions below.

If you have any issues with installation, please contact Devsim LLC through the github website:
https://github.com/devsim/devsim/issues

There are the required dependencies for ubuntu 12.04.
sudo apt-get install cmake git python2.7-dev g++ gcc gfortran make tcl8.5 tcl8.5-dev tcl-dev tclthread python2.7 python2.7-dev flex bison sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev zlib1g-dev libsqlite3-tcl

Similar dependencies are required for Redhat 6.4.

Note that tcl-dev package must be specified explicitly so that libtclstub.a is a symlink to tcl8.5-dev. Then SYMDIFF will compile properly.

For Mac OS X, the developer tools should be installed (Xcode 3.2.6), these contain all the necessary libraries.  The math libraries are from the Apple Accelerate Framework.  Note that a FORTRAN compiler is not required.
https://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools
https://developer.apple.com/performance/accelerateframework.html

For Mac OS X, Python 2.7.3 is required and may be downloaded from 
http://www.python.org/download

Note that the -j2 option for make and ctest is for building and testing in 2 parallel threads.  This number can be changed to run as many simultaneous processes as desired.

Download DEVSIM:
1. git clone git://github.com/devsim/devsim.git
2. cd devsim
3. git submodule init
4. git submodule update


Install ACML for linux 64bit.
1. acml-5-3-0-gfortran-64bit.tgz from http://developer.amd.com.
2. mkdir acml
3. tar xzvf ../acml-5-3-0-gfortran-64bit.tgz 
4. sudo sh install-acml-5-3-0-gfortran-64bit.sh

Install ACML for linux 32bit.
1. acml-4-4-0-gfortran-32bit.tgz from http://developer.amd.com.
2. mkdir acml
3. tar xzvf ../acml-4-4-0-gfortran-32bit.tgz 
4. sudo sh install-acml-4-4-0-gfortran-32bit.sh


For Mac OS X, make sure that you have XCode installed which has the math libraries.  In the following instructions use setup_osx_10.6.8.sh instead.

Compile SuperLU 4.3

1. cd external
2. wget http://crd-legacy.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU/superlu_4.3.tar.gz
3. tar xzvf superlu_4.3.tar.gz
4. cd SuperLU_4.3
5. sh ../superlu_ubuntu_12.04.sh

Compile SYMDIFF

1. cd external/symdiff
2. sh scripts/setup_ubuntu_12.04.sh
3. cd linux_x86_64_release
4. make -j2
5. ctest -j2

Compile DEVSIM
1. sh scripts/setup_ubuntu_12.04.sh
2. cd linux_x86_64_release
3. make -j2
4. ctest -j2

There are 2 executables are created:
linux_x86_64_release/src/main/devsim is a Tcl interpreter (deprecated)
linux_x86_64_release/src/main/devsim_py is a Python interpreter

If there are issues during the build, try using:
make VERBOSE=1

in order to see what the build process is doing at the point of failure.

Note that tests are based on exact text differences between files.  Different configuration options may affect results.  The following two tests will fail for the Redhat 6.4 configuration:
thread_1 (Failed)
fpetest2 (Timeout)

Many of the tests are written in Tcl, because that was the original
interpreter.
cd testing
../linux_x86_64_release/src/main/devsim sqlite1.tcl

The devsim_py examples import modules with a relative path, so you'd want
to do:
cd examples/diode
../../linux_x86_64_release/src/main/devsim_py diode_2d.py

You can see how tests are run in:
testing/CMakeLists.txt

You can see the actual commands run during the test using:
ctest -V

or more specifically:
ctest -V -R sqlite1

There are package_linux.sh and package_apple.sh scripts in the dist directories that make a self contained distribution from a build.
